## Idea
use yelp dataset for in a streaming format. (Producer randomly sending data)

- Use kafka Producer to send data to kafka topics
- use Kafka topic to store raw data.
- Use kafka consumer to transfer data to mongo collections
- create a model for sentiment analysis
- Compare BERT and model created by you.
- Create Kibana for storing and visualization
